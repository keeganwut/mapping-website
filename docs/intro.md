# Intro

This guide will help set you up with a local host server with spooner.

## Getting Started

### What you'll need

- [Keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/):
  - Very important as it is used to assign the server to your account for it to launch.
- [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/fileadmin/winrar-versions/winrar/winrar-x64-622.exe):
  - Used to unzip the server artifacts and spooner zips that you will be downloading.
- [CFX Server Artifacts](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/) version **6508** or **above**:
  - It is recommended to install version 6508 as this has the latest version of txAdmin and is stable.
- [RedM Spooner](https://github.com/keeganwut/spooner) (Keegan's Rendition)
- [Uiprompt](https://github.com/kibook/redm-uiprompt)
