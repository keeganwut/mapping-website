# Congratulations!

You have just learned the **basics of Server Development** and made some changes to the **CFX Template**.

## Things to note

- Make sure to restart your server after adding new resources via. txAdmin.
- If you close your command prompt or restart your computer you will have to start the server via. the FXServer.exe file.
- Any issues join my discord and privately message me.
- You can use the txAdmin menu by typing /tx in-game.
